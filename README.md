# Webm Looper Userscript

A userscript which automatically enables looping on Webm videos in your browser.
This requires you to have a userscript engine installed, one like GreaseMonkey, Scriptish or TamperMonkey.

# Enabling local files on GreaseMonkey

If you wish to use this on local files (file:/// urls) you need to enable this in GreaseMonkey.
Navigate to about:config in Firefox and search for `extensions.greasemonkey.fileIsGreaseable`. Flip this to true.

# Test .webm file

Github does strange things to my test webm file (darkens and loading thingy, but lightens up every replay) so for now please user your own or this file for testing.
